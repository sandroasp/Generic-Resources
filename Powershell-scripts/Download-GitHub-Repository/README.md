# How to Download a GitHub Repository with PowerShell
This is a PowerShell function to download a full GitHub repository and unzip it locally.
Because we are downloading the full repository in a Zip file we avoid reaching API Rate limit (60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests or 5000 requests per hour if you use Basic Authentication or OAuth)
 
THIS POWERSHELL IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
